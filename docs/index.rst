Welcome to Vaimo_Menu's documentation!
======================================

Vaimo_Menu is a Magento module that is used for creating dynamic menus for the frontend by using templates instead of
building HTML in PHP. The module includes templates of the most common menu structures which makes it easy for
the developers to start using it. The extensibility of the module makes it also easy for developers to do customisations
if needed. By using cache it will reduce the database calls and it will reuse the data for every menu on the site.

The module is runnable from the start and it works out of the box for the imitate and carbon theme.

Start by reading the :doc:`quick-start` guide.
